# Content: Supervised Learning
## Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

## Project Overview
In this project, supervised learning techniques are applied on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. First, data exploration is done to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques are applied to manipulate the data into a workable format. Then several supervised learners are evaluated on the data, and the best solution is picked. The model is then optimized. Finally, chosen model and its predictions under the hood are explored, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.

## Software Requirements

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

## Starting the Project

This project contains three files:

- `finding_donors.ipynb`: This is the main file with the model.
- `census.csv`: The project dataset. 
- `visuals.py`: A Python file containing visualization code.
